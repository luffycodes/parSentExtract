The property of high heat of vaporization means that water requires much more heat or energy in order to break the hydrogen bonds between water molecules and allow them to escape from a liquid to a gas. Due to this property water takes up energy when it evaporates, which cools the environment where the evaporation is taking place.","Cohesion is the attraction between the water molecules, which helps create surface tension. Insects can walk on water because of cohesion. Adhesion is the attraction between water molecules and other molecules.

"1. Because water has a high heat capacity, it cools down slowly, and this helps mammals to maintain an even temperature. Water takes heat from warm places to cool places and balances the temperature out. 2. Water's heat of vaporization means that a lot of energy is used in order for it to evaporate. When energy is released, it cools the environment. This is why sweating cools us down, which helps maintain our body temperature. 3. Frozen water is less dense than liquid water due to hydrogen bonding and the arrangement of the molecules.

"One example of how the characteristics of water are important to maintaining life includes the ability of frozen water (ice) to float. When the temperature drops significantly, ice will form on the surface of bodies of water such as lakes and ponds. When the ice forms, it creates a barrier to insulate the lake which protects the animals and plants from freezing. Another example of how characteristics of water are important to maintaining life is through its high heat capacity. Warm blooded animals can use water to transport heat from warm areas to cool areas in order to maintain homeostasis of body temperature. A third example is through evaporation. Evaporation of water helps to cool organisms through sweating. When the surface gets too hot, it excites the water molecules on the surface to break hydrogen bonds and therefore break away and take the heat energy with them making the surface cooler.","First, the lower density of water as a solid versus a liquid allows ice to float, forming an insulating surface layer for aquatic life.
